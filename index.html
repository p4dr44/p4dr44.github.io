<h1>About Parda</h1>
<br>
<p>
Hello. My real name is not Padra but I like to use it as a nickname on the internet.
<br>
I love the Matrix movie series and that's why I use Neo's profile picture on the internet. I have been 
<br>
interested in Linux and the world of programming and hacking since I was 13 years old. I am still 
<br>
learning new things. I am not a teacher or a professor but I like to share everything new that I learn 
<br>
with others. This is the main purpose of my activity in social networks. I believe that in today's 
<br>
world, people are not educated enough and this causes societies to be influenced by other powers. We can 
<br>
heal society by increasing the knowledge of people around us. If you want to learn new things with me, I 
<br>
can suggest you my channels:
