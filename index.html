<h1>About Parda</h1>
<br>
<p>
Hello. My real name is not Padra but I like to use it as a nickname on the internet. I love the Matrix movie series and that's why I use Neo's profile picture on the internet. I have been interested in Linux and the world of programming and hacking since I was 13 years old. I am still learning new things. I am not a teacher or a professor but I like to share everything new that I learn with others. This is the main purpose of my activity in social networks. I believe that in today's world, people are not educated enough and this causes societies to be influenced by other powers. We can heal society by increasing the knowledge of people around us. If you want to learn new things with me, I can suggest you my channels:
